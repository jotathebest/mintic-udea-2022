1. Write a Python program to get the difference between a given number and 17, if the number is greater than 17 return double the absolute difference.

Example:
if the number is 22, you should print 5
if the number is 14, you should print -3, which is the absolute difference between 14 and 17

2.  Write a Python program to calculate the sum of three given numbers, if the values are equal then return three times of their sum

Example:
if numbers are 1, 2 and 3, it should return 6
if three numbers are 12, it should return 3 * 12

3. Write a program that reads a number, n, given by the user and prints the squares of a number series from 1 to n. You must check that the inserted number is greater than 1.
Example:
if the number is 0, you should print "ERROR, number not valid"
if the number is 3, you should print 1, 4, 9
if the number is 5, you should print 1, 4, 9, 16, 25

4. Write a program that prints the prime numbers from 1 to 30.
Expected: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29
