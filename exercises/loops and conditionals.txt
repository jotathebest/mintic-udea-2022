1. Write a Python program to get the difference between a given number and 17, if the number is greater than 17 return double the absolute difference.

Example:
if the number is 22, you should print 5
if the number is 14, you should print -3, which is the absolute difference between 14 and 17

2.  Write a Python program to calculate the sum of three given numbers, if the values are equal then return three times of their sum

Example:
if numbers are 1, 2 and 3, it should return 6
if three numbers are 12, it should return 3 * 12

3. Write a program that reads a number, n, given by the user and prints the squares of a number series from 1 to n. You must check that the inserted number is greater than 1.
Example:
if the number is 0, you should print "ERROR, number not valid"
if the number is 3, you should print 1, 4, 9
if the number is 5, you should print 1, 4, 9, 16, 25

4. Write a program that prints the prime numbers from 1 to 30.
Expected: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29

5. Write a program that prints the following ASCII art using:
  5.1 A for loop
  5.2 A while loop

7. Body mass index (BMI) is a number calculated from a personâ€™s weight and height.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the BMI is a fairly
reliable indicator of body fatness for most people. BMI does not measure body fat
directly, but research has shown that BMI correlates to direct measures of body fat,
such as underwater weighing and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The formula for
BMI is

        weight/ height^2

where weight is in kilograms and height is in meters.
(a) Write a program that prompts for metric weight and height and outputs the BMI.
(b) Write a program that prompts for weight in pounds and height in inches, converts
the values to metric, and then calculates the BMI

8. Write a program that verifies if an user is in a DB. To do so, your DB will be the following list:

db = ["Jose Garcia", "Carolina Martinez", "Gonzalo Garcia", "Adam Philiphs", "George Washington"]

The user will have three attempts to try to insert a name available in the db, if the attempts are reached, you should print a message "ERROR, max attemtps reached".
If the user has not reached the attempts and the name does not exist, you should print "ERROR, the name does not exist"
If the name is in the DB, you should print "OK, the name exists"

Example 1:
user: Jose Perez
prompt: ERROR, the name does not exist
user: George Washington
prompt: Ok, the name exists

Example 1:
user: Jose Perez
prompt: ERROR, the name does not exist
user: Pepito Sanchez
prompt: ERROR, the name does not exist
user: George Orwell
prompt: ERROR, max attemtps reached

8. Write a program to calculate the final note of a student given the following conditions:
  1. The note is composed by four scores: exam, homework, lesson and practice
  2. Every score has the following weights:
     | exam     | 50% |
     | homework | 20% |
     | lesson   | 15% |
     | practice | 15% |
  3. The final note will be the sum of the product of the scores by their weights

The program should retrieve from the user the four scores to calculate the final note, but this one should be printed as a letter by fitting the following rules:

  | final note                    | letter  |
  | Between 0 and 2 (inclusive)   |    E    |
  | Between 2 and 3 (inclusive)   |    D    |
  | Between 3 and 3.5 (inclusive) |    C    |
  | Between 3.5 and 4 (inclusive) |    B    |
  | Between 4 and 4.5 (inclusive) |    B+   |
  | Greater than 5                |    A    |

Example 1:
exam = 5
lesson, = 3 
homework = 0
practice = 1

The program should print "C"

Example 2:
exam = 4.5
lesson, = 2 
homework = 3.9
practice = 2.5

The program should print "B"
