# Exercise 1
# Create a function that receives a list as input parameter, multiplies all the numbers (float, int)
# inside the list by 2 and returns the new values.

# Example:
# input --> [True, "jose", "garcia", 1, 3.4, False, (), [], {"a": 1}]
# output --> [True, "jose", "garcia", 2, 6.8, False, (), [], {"a": 1}]

# Create a function that sorts a list

# Exercise 2
# Write a function that prints the squares of a series from 1 to N, where N is an input parameter
# The function should print an error message, if N < 0.

# Exercise 3
# Write a Python function to find the Max of three numbers.

# 3.1 Receive inputs as comma separated
# def <name> (<arg_1>, <arg_2>, ... <arg_n>):
#     <algorithm>
#     [optional] return <result>

# 3.2 Receive inputs as a args
# def <name> (*args):
#     <algorithm>
#     [optional] return <result>

# 3.3 Receive inputs as a kwargs
# def <name> (**kwargs):
#     <algorithm>
#     [optional] return <result>


# Exercise 4
# Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.
# input --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 7, 9]
# output --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9]

# Exercise 6

# Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list. 
# Sample List : (8, 2, 3, -1, 7)
# Expected Output : -336

# Exercise 7

# Write a Python program to reverse a string
# Sample String : "1234abcd"
# Expected Output : "dcba4321"
